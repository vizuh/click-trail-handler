Complete marketing attribution: UTMs & Click IDs for WooCommerce and forms. Built-in consent banner + Google Consent Mode support.

== Description ==

Most WordPress sites lose campaign data the moment a visitor clicks away from the landing page. If the user doesn’t convert immediately, the UTM/click ID context often never makes it into your form entry or WooCommerce order — leaving you with “Direct / None” conversions and a huge reporting blind spot.

ClickTrail fixes that.

It captures first-touch and last-touch UTMs + click IDs (gclid, fbclid, ttclid, msclkid, and more), stores them in first-party cookies (with consent), and automatically injects that attribution into supported form submissions and WooCommerce orders — even when the buyer journey takes multiple pages or multiple sessions.

= Why this matters (ROI, not just tracking) =

* **Illuminate “lost conversions”**: Without proper UTM persistence, marketing becomes guesswork — you’re effectively optimizing in the dark. ClickTrail ensures each lead/order carries its true source so you can prove what’s working.
* **Reduce wasted ad spend**: Industry reports estimate large chunks of marketing spend are wasted when measurement is incomplete or misattributed. ClickTrail helps you recover missing signals so you can cut spend that isn’t converting and scale what is.
* **Make better decisions with real data**: Many marketers still don’t trust their attribution data. ClickTrail gives you clean first-touch and last-touch context inside WordPress — where the conversion actually happens.

= Concrete example =

A visitor clicks a Google Ads campaign, browses a few pages, leaves, and comes back next week to buy.
With ClickTrail, the WooCommerce order still records the original utm_source=google and the relevant campaign/click IDs (first-touch + last-touch).
Without this type of persistence, that purchase often shows up as “Direct” or loses the campaign context in your lead/order records.

= Key Features =

* **Accurate attribution (first + last touch)**: Persist first-touch and last-touch UTMs and click IDs for up to 90 days, then inject them into supported forms and WooCommerce orders automatically.
* **WooCommerce insights**: View a "Source" column in orders and a detailed attribution meta box on each order edit screen.
* **GA4-ready purchase events**: Push enriched purchase events from WooCommerce thank-you pages, including campaign data and line items, while preventing duplicate firing.
* **Broad click ID coverage**: Capture IDs from Google (gclid, wbraid, gbraid), Meta (fbclid), TikTok (ttclid), Microsoft (msclkid), Twitter/X (twclid), LinkedIn (li_fat_id), Snapchat (ScCid), and Pinterest (epik).
* **Event tracking built-in**: Track searches, file downloads, scroll depth (25%, 50%, 75%, 90%), time on page, logins, signups, and comments with dataLayer pushes.
* **Privacy-aware by default**: Built-in consent banner + Google Consent Mode defaults, with Strict, Relaxed, or Geo-based modes.

= Consent Options =

* Built-in consent banner with Google Consent Mode defaults injected in the <head>.
* Configure strict, relaxed, or geo-based consent behavior to align with your region and policies.
* Control cookie duration and whether consent is required before storing attribution.
* Optional admin warnings help you avoid accidentally storing personal data inside UTMs/campaign parameters.

= GA4 & Analytics Integrations =

* GA4-ready purchase event with campaign data and line items.
* dataLayer events for WooCommerce and engagement tracking (client/server-side).
* Manual Google Tag Manager container ID injection for sites without a theme-level GTM snippet.

= Supported Platforms =

* **Forms**: Contact Form 7 (hidden fields auto-populated), Fluent Forms, and Gravity Forms scaffolding for dynamic population.
* **Commerce**: WooCommerce attribution metadata, session count, and admin UI enhancements.
* **Messaging**: Optional attribution append for WhatsApp links (`wa.me`, `whatsapp.com`, `api.whatsapp.com`) without click logging.

== Installation ==

1.  Install via **Plugins  Add New** (search "ClickTrail") or upload to /wp-content/plugins/click-trail-handler.
2.  Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen in WordPress.
3.  Navigate to **ClickTrail  Attribution & Consent Settings** to configure cookie duration, consent mode (Strict, Relaxed, or Geo-based), and GA4/GTM options.
4.  Test it: Submit a form or complete a purchase with UTM parameters in the URL to verify attribution is captured.
5.  Optional: Enable the consent banner and review Google Consent Mode defaults to stay compliant with privacy regulations.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Doesn't GA4 already solve attribution? =

GA4 can attribute sessions, but it doesn't automatically push campaign parameters into your WordPress form submissions or WooCommerce order records. ClickTrail persists UTMs/click IDs in first-party cookies (with consent) and injects them into the conversion record inside WordPress, so your leads and orders retain their true source.

= What's the difference between first-touch and last-touch? =

First-touch shows the campaign that originally brought the visitor to your site. Last-touch shows the most recent campaign/click before conversion. Seeing both helps you understand what starts demand vs. what closes it.

= What data does ClickTrail store and for how long? =

ClickTrail stores attribution data (UTMs, click IDs, landing page, and session count) in first-party cookies for up to 90 days (configurable) and injects the values into supported form submissions and WooCommerce orders.

= Which click IDs and parameters are supported? =

The plugin captures gclid, wbraid, gbraid (Google Ads), fbclid (Facebook), ttclid (TikTok), msclkid (Microsoft), twclid (Twitter/X), li_fat_id (LinkedIn), ScCid (Snapchat), and epik (Pinterest) alongside your standard UTM parameters.

= Does the consent banner block tracking until approval? =

If you enable **Require Consent for Tracking**, ClickTrail will defer storing attribution until the visitor accepts. Strict, Relaxed, and Geo-based presets control whether tracking is granted or denied by default.

= How does WhatsApp support work? =

When enabled, ClickTrail can append encoded attribution context to WhatsApp message links. It no longer logs WhatsApp click events by default.

= How do I enable GA4 purchase events? =

Enable **GA4 Purchase Event** in the settings. The plugin fires a GA4-ready purchase event on the WooCommerce thank-you page with first- and last-touch attribution data and line items.

= Is ClickTrail GDPR compliant? =

ClickTrail provides consent controls and Consent Mode defaults, but ultimate compliance depends on your configuration. Use the built-in banner for lightweight sites or integrate with a dedicated CMP (e.g., Cookiebot, OneTrust, Borlabs) for stricter regulatory needs.
